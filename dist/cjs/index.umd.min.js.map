They can be used on their own or in conjunction with other Luxon types; for example, you can use {@link DateTime.plus} to add a Duration object to a DateTime, producing another DateTime.\r\n *\r\n * Here is a brief overview of commonly used methods and getters in Duration:\r\n *\r\n * * **Creation** To create a Duration, use {@link Duration.fromMillis}, {@link Duration.fromObject}, or {@link Duration.fromISO}.\r\n * * **Unit values** See the {@link Duration.years}, {@link Duration.months}, {@link Duration.weeks}, {@link Duration.days}, {@link Duration.hours}, {@link Duration.minutes}, {@link Duration.seconds}, {@link Duration.milliseconds} accessors.\r\n * * **Configuration** See  {@link Duration.locale} and {@link Duration.numberingSystem} accessors.\r\n * * **Transformation** To create new Durations out of old ones use {@link Duration.plus}, {@link Duration.minus}, {@link Duration.normalize}, {@link Duration.set}, {@link Duration.reconfigure}, {@link Duration.shiftTo}, and {@link Duration.negate}.\r\n * * **Output** To convert the Duration into other representations, see {@link Duration.as}, {@link Duration.toISO}, {@link Duration.toFormat}, and {@link Duration.toJSON}\r\n *\r\n * There's are more methods documented below.

It contains class and instance methods for creating, parsing, interrogating, transforming, and formatting them.\r\n *\r\n * A DateTime comprises of:\r\n * * A timestamp. Each DateTime instance refers to a specific millisecond of the Unix epoch.\r\n * * A time zone. Each instance is considered in the context of a specific zone (by default the local system's zone).\r\n * * Configuration properties that effect how output strings are formatted, such as `locale`, `numberingSystem`, and `outputCalendar`.\r\n *\r\n * Here is a brief overview of the most commonly used functionality it provides:\r\n *\r\n * * **Creation**: To create a DateTime from its components, use one of its factory class methods: {@link local}, {@link utc}, and (most flexibly) {@link fromObject}. To create one from a standard string format, use {@link fromISO}, {@link fromHTTP}, and {@link fromRFC2822}. To create one from a custom string format, use {@link fromFormat}. To create one from a native JS date, use {@link fromJSDate}.\r\n * * **Gregorian calendar and time**: To examine the Gregorian properties of a DateTime individually (i.e as opposed to collectively through {@link toObject}), use the {@link year}, {@link month},\r\n * {@link day}, {@link hour}, {@link minute}, {@link second}, {@link millisecond} accessors.\r\n * * **Week calendar**: For ISO week calendar attributes, see the {@link weekYear}, {@link weekNumber}, and {@link weekday} accessors.\r\n * * **Configuration** See the {@link locale} and {@link numberingSystem} accessors.\r\n * * **Transformation**: To transform the DateTime into other DateTimes, use {@link set}, {@link reconfigure}, {@link setZone}, {@link setLocale}, {@link plus}, {@link minus}, {@link endOf}, {@link startOf}, {@link toUTC}, and {@link toLocal}.\r\n * * **Output**: To convert the DateTime to other representations, use the {@link toRelative}, {@link toRelativeCalendar}, {@link toJSON}, {@link toISO}, {@link toHTTP}, {@link toObject}, {@link toRFC2822}, {@link toString}, {@link toLocaleString}, {@link toFormat}, {@link toMillis} and {@link toJSDate}.\r\n *\r\n * There's plenty others documented below.
