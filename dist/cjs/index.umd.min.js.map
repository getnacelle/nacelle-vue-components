Here's how it works:\r\n * Two things go into parsing: a regex to match with and an extractor to take apart the groups in the match.\r\n * An extractor is just a function that takes a regex match array and returns a { year: ..., month: ... } object\r\n * parse() does the work of executing the regex and applying the extractor. It takes multiple regex/extractor pairs to try in sequence.\r\n * Extractors can take a \"cursor\" representing the offset in the match to look at. This makes it easy to combine extractors.\r\n * combineExtractors() does the work of combining them, keeping track of the cursor through multiple extractions.\r\n * Some extractions are super dumb and simpleParse and fromStrings help DRY them.\r\n */\n\nfunction combineRegexes() {\n  for (var _len = arguments.length, regexes = new Array(_len), _key = 0; _key < _len; _key++) {\n    regexes[_key] = arguments[_key];\n  }\n\n  var full = regexes.reduce(function (f, r) {\n    return f + r.source;\n  }, \"\");\n  return RegExp(\"^\" + full + \"$\");\n}\n\nfunction combineExtractors() {\n  for (var _len2 = arguments.length, extractors = new Array(_len2), _key2 = 0; _key2 < _len2; _key2++) {\n    extractors[_key2] = arguments[_key2];\n  }\n\n  return function (m) {\n    return extractors.reduce(function (_ref, ex) {\n      var mergedVals = _ref[0],\n          mergedZone = _ref[1],\n          cursor = _ref[2];\n\n      var _ex = ex(m, cursor),\n          val = _ex[0],\n          zone = _ex[1],\n          next = _ex[2];\n\n      return [Object.assign(mergedVals, val), mergedZone || zone, next];\n    }, [{}, null, 1]).slice(0, 2);\n  };\n}\n\nfunction parse(s) {\n  if (s == null) {\n    return [null, null];\n  }\n\n  for (var _len3 = arguments.length, patterns = new Array(_len3 > 1 ? _len3 - 1 : 0), _key3 = 1; _key3 < _len3; _key3++) {\n    patterns[_key3 - 1] = arguments[_key3];\n  }\n\n  for (var _i = 0, _patterns = patterns; _i < _patterns.length; _i++) {\n    var _patterns$_i = _patterns[_i],\n        regex = _patterns$_i[0],\n        extractor = _patterns$_i[1];\n    var m = regex.exec(s);\n\n    if (m) {\n      return extractor(m);\n    }\n  }\n\n  return [null, null];\n}\n\nfunction simpleParse() {\n  for (var _len4 = arguments.length, keys = new Array(_len4), _key4 = 0; _key4 < _len4; _key4++) {\n    keys[_key4] = arguments[_key4];\n  }\n\n  return function (match, cursor) {\n    var ret = {};\n    var i;\n\n    for (i = 0; i < keys.length; i++) {\n      ret[keys[i]] = parseInteger(match[cursor + i]);\n    }\n\n    return [ret, null, cursor + i];\n  };\n} // ISO and SQL parsing\n\n\nvar offsetRegex = /(?:(Z)|([+-]\\d\\d)(?::?(\\d\\d))?)/,\n    isoTimeBaseRegex = /(\\d\\d)(?::?(\\d\\d)(?::?(\\d\\d)(?:[.,](\\d{1,9}))?)?)?/,\n    isoTimeRegex = RegExp(\"\" + isoTimeBaseRegex.source + offsetRegex.source + \"?\"),\n    isoTimeExtensionRegex = RegExp(\"(?:T\" + isoTimeRegex.source + \")?\"),\n    isoYmdRegex = /([+-]\\d{6}|\\d{4})(?:-?(\\d\\d)(?:-?(\\d\\d))?)?/,\n    isoWeekRegex = /(\\d{4})-?W(\\d\\d)(?:-?(\\d))?/,\n    isoOrdinalRegex = /(\\d{4})-?(\\d{3})/,\n    extractISOWeekData = simpleParse(\"weekYear\", \"weekNumber\", \"weekDay\"),\n    extractISOOrdinalData = simpleParse(\"year\", \"ordinal\"),\n    sqlYmdRegex = /(\\d{4})-(\\d\\d)-(\\d\\d)/,\n    // dumbed-down version of the ISO one\nsqlTimeRegex = RegExp(isoTimeBaseRegex.source + \" ?(?:\" + offsetRegex.source + \"|(\" + ianaRegex.source + \"))?\"),\n    sqlTimeExtensionRegex = RegExp(\"(?: \" + sqlTimeRegex.source + \")?\");\n\nfunction extractISOYmd(match, cursor) {\n  var item = {\n    year: parseInteger(match[cursor]),\n    month: parseInteger(match[cursor + 1]) || 1,\n    day: parseInteger(match[cursor + 2]) || 1\n  };\n  return [item, null, cursor + 3];\n}\n\nfunction extractISOTime(match, cursor) {\n  var item = {\n    hour: parseInteger(match[cursor]) || 0,\n    minute: parseInteger(match[cursor + 1]) || 0,\n    second: parseInteger(match[cursor + 2]) || 0,\n    millisecond: parseMillis(match[cursor + 3])\n  };\n  return [item, null, cursor + 4];\n}\n\nfunction extractISOOffset(match, cursor) {\n  var local = !match[cursor] && !match[cursor + 1],\n      fullOffset = signedOffset(match[cursor + 1], match[cursor + 2]),\n      zone = local ? null : FixedOffsetZone.instance(fullOffset);\n  return [{}, zone, cursor + 3];\n}\n\nfunction extractIANAZone(match, cursor) {\n  var zone = match[cursor] ?

It contains class and instance methods for creating, parsing, interrogating, transforming, and formatting them.\r\n *\r\n * A DateTime comprises of:\r\n * * A timestamp. Each DateTime instance refers to a specific millisecond of the Unix epoch.\r\n * * A time zone. Each instance is considered in the context of a specific zone (by default the local system's zone).\r\n * * Configuration properties that effect how output strings are formatted, such as `locale`, `numberingSystem`, and `outputCalendar`.\r\n *\r\n * Here is a brief overview of the most commonly used functionality it provides:\r\n *\r\n * * **Creation**: To create a DateTime from its components, use one of its factory class methods: {@link local}, {@link utc}, and (most flexibly) {@link fromObject}. To create one from a standard string format, use {@link fromISO}, {@link fromHTTP}, and {@link fromRFC2822}. To create one from a custom string format, use {@link fromFormat}. To create one from a native JS date, use {@link fromJSDate}.\r\n * * **Gregorian calendar and time**: To examine the Gregorian properties of a DateTime individually (i.e as opposed to collectively through {@link toObject}), use the {@link year}, {@link month},\r\n * {@link day}, {@link hour}, {@link minute}, {@link second}, {@link millisecond} accessors.\r\n * * **Week calendar**: For ISO week calendar attributes, see the {@link weekYear}, {@link weekNumber}, and {@link weekday} accessors.\r\n * * **Configuration** See the {@link locale} and {@link numberingSystem} accessors.\r\n * * **Transformation**: To transform the DateTime into other DateTimes, use {@link set}, {@link reconfigure}, {@link setZone}, {@link setLocale}, {@link plus}, {@link minus}, {@link endOf}, {@link startOf}, {@link toUTC}, and {@link toLocal}.\r\n * * **Output**: To convert the DateTime to other representations, use the {@link toRelative}, {@link toRelativeCalendar}, {@link toJSON}, {@link toISO}, {@link toHTTP}, {@link toObject}, {@link toRFC2822}, {@link toString}, {@link toLocaleString}, {@link toFormat}, {@link toMillis} and {@link toJSDate}.\r\n *\r\n * There's plenty others documented below. In addition, for more information on subtler topics like internationalization, time zones, alternative calendars, validity, and so on, see the external documentation.\r\n */\n\n\nvar DateTime =\n/*#__PURE__*/\nfunction () {\n  /**\r\n   * @access private\r\n   */\n  function DateTime(config) {\n    var zone = config.zone || Settings.defaultZone,\n        invalid = config.invalid || (Number.isNaN(config.ts) ? new Invalid(\"invalid input\") : null) || (!zone.isValid ? unsupportedZone(zone) : null);\n    /**\r\n     * @access private\r\n     */\n\n    this.ts = isUndefined(config.ts) ?
